# Swift-Projectile-Prediction-Trajectory

Create a prediction trajectory using this code. Emulate the effect created by games such as angry birds; in which they show where the projectile is going to move after release.

Creators: Michael Loubier & Timofey Makhlay

This code has been implemented into a game called AlienEscape.

There are many ways to go about creating a Projectile Trajectory, but most of the use walk arounds: such as creating invisible projectiles and map their trajectory every time that the angle and impulse changes. This is the most percise and easy to load way. 

Well known games such as Angry Birds were able to achieve the same effect trhough already pre-made tools within software such as Unity; tools that are not avaliable in xCode.

### How to use:  

The "Projectile-Prediction-Trajectory.swift" file will contain the necessary code to create your Projectile Prediction Trajectory line.

See the code in use in "sample-Projectile-Prediction-Trajectory.swift".
